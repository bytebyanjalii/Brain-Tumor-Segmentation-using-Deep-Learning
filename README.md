🧠 Brain Tumor Segmentation Using Deep Learning 🧠

I have developed a deep learning–powered system for the automated segmentation of brain tumors from MRI scans 🧬🖼️. Leveraging the power of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and a U-Net-based architecture 🧱, the model accurately identifies and delineates tumor regions across various MRI modalities such as T1, T2, and FLAIR 🧾.

📦 Dataset:
Our model was trained and evaluated on the widely used BraTS dataset 🧑‍⚕️🗂️, which contains labeled MRI images with expert annotations for tumor core, enhancing tumor, and edema.

⚙️ Technology Stack:

▸ 🧠 Deep Learning (TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch)

▸ 🏗️ U-Net Architecture

▸ 📈 Metrics: Dice Score, IoU

▸ 💾 Medical Imaging (MRI slices)

📊 Model Performance:

▸ 🎯 Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC): ~0.91

▸ 📐 Intersection over Union (IoU): ~0.87

▸ 🔍 High segmentation precision across multi-class tumor regions

🔬 Use Case & Impact:
This system is designed to assist radiologists and neurosurgeons 🧑‍⚕️🧑‍⚕️ by providing:

▸ ⚡ Faster tumor localization

▸ 🧾 Accurate delineation for treatment planning

▸ 📉 Reduced diagnostic workload and human error

▸ ⏱️ Improved clinical efficiency in early detection and monitoring

💡 By automating this critical diagnostic task, our solution aims to enhance clinical decision-making, support early intervention, and advance AI integration in healthcare 🏥💡.
